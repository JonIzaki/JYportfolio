								<h3>About the project</h3>
								<p>I have joined the indie game studio “FlowFireGames” developing “Synthetik2” from its first lines of code to release as part of a small and professional team of developers. 
									Synthetik2 is a tactical roguelite twin-stick shooter that supports endless replayability through randomization and the amount of content provided through weapon and item variety, maps, and community developed mods.
									Our main goal was to recreate the feeling of the games prequel "Synthetik" and improve on many of its systems, while moving from "GameMaker" game engine to "Unity" and from 2D to 3D.
									The engineering team had an ambitious goal coming into the project and it included the creation of a flexible framework layer which would 
									provide systems to streamline development of Synthetik2 and future games, as well as make Synthetik2 as moddable as possible.</p>

								<h3>Framework</h3>
								<p>During our  pre-production stage I was architecting key systems of said framework such as our content management pipeline and its powerful “UniversEdit” tool which was used heavily by our designers and is still used by game modders.<br> 
									This work on the framework was exciting for me as I used advanced C# functionality to implement robust systems that served as a building block for the rest of the game's development.
									Designing and implementing our content management module with its content creation tool "UniversEdit" provided me with in-depth experience of creating encapsulated
									and efficient systems which can be reliably extended through the development process. Also, providing a heavily used tool such as the "UniversEdit" provided me with UX design as the tools users were sitting next to me and would openly communicate their quality of life needs.
								</p>

								<h3>UI</h3>
								<p>As development progressed I worked closely with artists and designers on the design and implementation of most of the game's UI.<br>
									This work included the design process where we aimed on streamlining complex systems, the creation of UI tools to support my colleagues workflow and the implementation of the underlying logic invoked by the players actions.
									A notable module I worked on are the class selection screen which includes multiple UI systems simplified into a compact screen that includes a class selection tab, weapon and item shop and more. 
									There I implemented the screens functionality that includes dynamically loading classes (including game mods), unlockable shops, the saving\loading of the players preferences and more.<br>
									This provided me with an in-depth experience of working as part of a cross-disciplinary team exploring features in a heavy iterative process.
								</p>

								<h3>Gameplay</h3>
								<p>
									On the gameplay front I was mainly focusing on developing core systems such as projectile system, damage system, 
									saving system, gameplay loop and more. I enjoyed the challenge of creating systems that needed
									 to be performant and responsive as well as satisfying my passion for math with some 3D math problems.
									A system I'm proud of designing is the projectile system where I used the Entity Component System pattern
									which I decided to use following Unity's DOTS talks. 
									This system controls the projectile movement in a game where potentially hundreds of projectiles can be present at any frame, 
									and each projectile can have a unique movement behavior out of tens of different behaviors desired by the designer. 
									Developing this system using the ECS pattern allowed for great performance and flexibility which seemed perfect for a projectile system, and it was.
